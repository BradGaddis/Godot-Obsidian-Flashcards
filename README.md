# Godot-Obsidian-Flashcards
A simple Python script to convert GODOT .html to useable .md files for the Spaced Repition plugin for Obsidian

---

This is a quick script that translates the documentation for Godot into flash cards for Spaced Repition.

Yes, it could be better, but the idea is just to have a way to study the documenation. I intend to expand this script for other types of documenation, as well.

## How to use:

- Dowload [the docs](https://nightly.link/godotengine/godot-docs/workflows/build_offline_docs/master/godot-docs-html-master.zip) for Godot
- Unzip them
- Add the source and destination paths to the method at the bottom of the script.
